# Enterprise Multi-Currency Ledger

Static, single-file-style PWA (IndexedDB-based, offline-first, no backend).
Deploy the contents of this folder as-is (e.g. to GitHub Pages).

## Files

```
index.html      ← page structure + styles + the CSP <meta> tag
ledger.js       ← all app logic (external file — see CSP notes in index.html <head>)
sw.js           ← Service Worker: offline caching (CACHE_NAME / ASSETS_TO_CACHE)
manifest.json   ← Web App Manifest (installable as a PWA)

## Deploy checklist

- [ ] Push **`index.html` and `ledger.js` together** — the CSP requires app
      logic to live in the external `ledger.js`; if only `index.html` goes
      up, the page loads to a blank screen (it requests a file that isn't there).
- [ ] Bump **both** version markers if you're shipping a change worth being
      able to identify at a glance — they do **not** sync automatically,
      since they live in different files:
  - `APP_VERSION` / `APP_VERSION_DATE` near the top of `ledger.js` — the
    display label shown in the small version badge, bottom-right of the
    screen (visible even on the lock screen, before the passcode is
    entered).
  - `CACHE_NAME` near the top of `sw.js` — controls which cached files the
    Service Worker actually serves. This is the one that matters for
    whether people actually get your new code; the badge is just a label.
  - Each file has a comment pointing at the other as a reminder.
- [ ] If `ledger.js` changed, make sure it's still listed in `sw.js`'s
      `ASSETS_TO_CACHE` (it should already be there — just checking nothing
      dropped it).
- [ ] Test via `http://localhost:PORT` (`python3 -m http.server 8000`), not
      by double-clicking `index.html` — the CSP's `'self'` checks behave
      differently under `file://` and can produce misleading failures that
      don't happen in real (`https://`) deployment.

## About the version badge

The badge only reflects what code **shipped** in this build — it's read
directly from the `ledger.js` that's currently running, so it can't tell
you whether the *browser* is actually running that latest `ledger.js` or a
stale cached copy.

**If the badge shows a version that doesn't match what you just deployed,
that's the signal to hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or clear the site's
Service Worker/cache in devtools — not a signal that the deploy itself
failed.** The Service Worker is deliberately cache-first for offline
support, so a browser tab that was already open (or opened again quickly)
can keep serving the old `ledger.js` until the new `CACHE_NAME` causes the
old cache to be dropped and re-fetched.

## Security notes

See the CSP design-note comment at the top of `index.html`'s `<head>` for
the full reasoning behind the Content-Security-Policy, and the
`escapeHtml()` comment near the top of `ledger.js` for why user-entered
free text (account/category names, transaction descriptions) is always
passed through it before being inserted into the page.
